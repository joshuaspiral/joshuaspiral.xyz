## Introduction
The most common keyboard layout on computers nowadays is the QWERTY layout. With knowledge of this fact, it may lead you to believe that it is simply the most efficient layout that exists. However, the real reason most keyboards use this layout is simply due to the first typewriters getting jammed with other layouts. Well, nowadays, *not everyone* is using a typewriter on their computers, and there are several keyboard layouts that offer better comfort, why aren't we all using Dvorak or Colemak or some other layout? In reality, everyone is just too accustomed to QWERTY that it would be impractical for most people to relearn to type. However, for some people, it may be beneficial to learn a more efficient layout. With most of modern work being on computers, risk of injury is quite high, so for programmers or jobs that require long hours at a keyboard and computer, investing some time into better ergonomics and comfort can greatly enhance your productivity.
