## What is this site?
This site was created to share my content across the internet. I write about topics that interest me, or things that I want to share. I am a [GNU](https://gnu.org)/[Linux](kernel.org) user. I also have another website at [toxicfs.xyz](https://toxicfs.xyz).

## Software I use
My current setup is [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org) with dwm and dwmblocks, by [suckless](https://suckless.org/) running on X. Here are my [dotfiles](https://github.com/joshuaspiral/dotfiles) (note that they are very CUSTOMISED for me, do not blindly copy the configs).
- Text/code editor: [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/).
- Terminal emulator: [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

## Programming languages
I am most experienced with Python, however I have been learning C/C++, read about a Connect Four AI written in C [here](https://joshuaspiral.xyz/posts/making-a-connect-four-ai).
