        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The most common keyboard layout on computers nowadays is the QWERTY layout. With knowledge of this fact, it may lead you to believe that it is simply the most efficient layout that exists. However, the real reason most keyboards use this layout is simply due to the first typewriters getting jammed with other layouts. Well, nowadays, <em>not everyone</em> is using a typewriter on their computers, and there are several keyboard layouts that offer better comfort. Why aren&rsquo;t we all using Dvorak or Colemak or some other layout? In reality, everyone is just too accustomed to QWERTY that it would be impractical for most people to relearn to type. However, for some people, it may be beneficial to learn a more efficient layout. With most of modern work being done on computers, the risk of injury is quite high, so for programmers or jobs that require long hours at a keyboard and computer, investing some time into better ergonomics and comfort can greatly enhance your productivity.</p>

<h2 id="my-7-experience-learning-the-layout">My 7 experience learning the layout</h2>
<p>The first day was very painful, I started out using <a href="https://keybr.com">keybr</a> and Colemak Academy. I was stuck on the homerow for a day or two, but eventually, it became easier. Days 2-4 were filled with steady progress, I was still using keybr at the time, and I reached 40-50 wpm with almost 95% accuracy. On day 5, I moved to monkeytype. This was when my progress skyrocketed to 70-80 wpm. Somewhere here, the layout finally clicked for me, and I understood the value of an alternative layout. I focused more on accuracy over speed, and my speed also improved from not having to correct mistakes. By day 7, I had a steady 80-90 wpm in 50 word mode.</p>

<h2 id="issues-with-the-layout">Issues with the layout</h2>
<p>Like many learners, I found it difficult to hit the D and H keys when typing, I would&rsquo;ve learned the Colemak-DH layout instead, which aims to solve this problem, but I was already too far into vanilla Colemak. Another major issue I faced with a heavily customised Linux system was with personalised keybindings, I had to remap all my &ldquo;vim mode&rdquo; keybindings with <code>hnei</code> instead, and setting a vimrc for Colemak is not very fun because the commands were mostly muscle memory, so it may take some time for me to adapt to this new way.</p>
<h2 id="closing-comments">Closing comments</h2>
<p>Would I recommend this layout to anyone? Probably not, but if you are someone who types a lot, and you experience discomfort with a layout like QWERTY, I would recommend trying the layout. However, I would not recommend learning the layout while you have things to do, like school or work, because for a few days, the layout will ruin your computing experience. I mainly learned the layout during Easter break, so I had time to adapt before returning to work. Overall, this was a very interesting experience, and it opened my eyes to the community of split keyboards and modern workflows. I can see myself using Colemak for a while. However, using computers with QWERTY is going to be a world of pain.</p>
